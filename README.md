This repo holds my notes for a presentation I gave while working as a software develop at the Wellcome Sanger Institute.
The notes on Test Driven Development were compiled from resources below:

- **Book:** Test-Driven Development by Example *(by Kent Beck)*
- **Article:** When to Mock *(by Robert C. Martin aka Uncle Bob)*
- **Talk** TDD, Where Did It All Go Wrong *(by Ian Cooper)*
- **Talk** TDD Revisited *(by Ian Cooper)*
